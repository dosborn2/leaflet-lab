        <panel> Future population has been and a will continue to be a trending topic.  When thinking about this map, I was curious to see how the future populations compared to one another of different countries.
          It was interesting to see that some countries such as China, the population began to decrease half way through the century.  China's population begins at 1.4 trillion
          in 2020 and by 2080 the population is down to 1.1 trillion people. This is most likely the outcome of their 'one-child' policy.
          Unfortunately the United States population will continue to increase from 333 milion to 430 million in the next 60 years.  Not only can the trends of one countries populations
          through time be viewed but also the comparison of one country to another over time.  In the overlay option there is a check box that allows the user to look at capitals of the
          countries selected and a popup is displayed with the cities 2017 population.  Not only can you see where the capital is located but also if the capital city is
          a populated one, and it can be compared to the contries population to see if the heavily populated countries have heavily populated capitals.
